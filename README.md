# ComfyUI-Pt-Wrapper  

ComfyUI-Pt-Wrapper is a spin-off of [ComfyUI-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/HowToSD/ComfyUI-Data-Analysis), created to provide a dedicated extension for PyTorch wrapper nodes originally included in the analysis extension.  

This extension offers an extensive collection of nodes for direct operations on PyTorch tensors, along with specialized nodes for machine learning tasks such as ResNet.  

For instance, you can train an image classification model using your own image data **without writing any code**.  

Check out [this tutorial on classifying dogs and cats](docs/dog_cat_classification_model_training.md).  

If you need visualization or analysis features, install ComfyUI-Data-Analysis as well.
