## Update (3/25/2025) 

GRU support has been added.
Check out new example workflow at `examples/workflows/gru_classification.json` which achieves approximately **87% validation accuracy** for IMDB sentiment classification (which is in the expected range for GRU).

# ComfyUI-Pt-Wrapper  

ComfyUI-Pt-Wrapper is a spin-off of [ComfyUI-Data-Analysis](https://github.com/HowToSD/ComfyUI-Data-Analysis), designed as a dedicated extension for PyTorch wrapper nodes originally included in the analysis extension.

This extension provides a comprehensive set of nodes for direct operations on PyTorch tensors, along with specialized nodes for machine learning tasks like ResNet.

If you need access to PyTorch's low-level methods (e.g., `add`, `div`, `max`, `where`, `scatter`, `gather`) to manipulate tensors or extract informationâ€”or if you're comfortable with ComfyUI and want to explore foundational PyTorch methods â€”this extension is for you.

You can train an image classification model using your own image data **without writing any code**.

Check out [this tutorial on classifying dogs and cats](docs/dog_cat_classification_model_training.md).

For visualization or analysis features, install ComfyUI-Data-Analysis as well.

The workflow directory offers user-friendly example workflows for training a high-performing ResNet model on CIFAR-10. One example achieved **94.34% accuracy** on the validation set. While not a state-of-the-art metric, it provides a solid starting point for customizing the workflow to your needs.

# Getting Started
If you're interested in direct operations on PyTorch tensors, check out the [Node Reference](docs/reference/node_reference.md) to explore the available nodes and see what operations are supported.

If you want to learn PyTorch model training, start with the [Model Training Documentation](docs/model_training.md).
