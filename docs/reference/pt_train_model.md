# Pt Train Model
Trains a model using a given dataset, loss function, optimizer, and number of epochs with learning rate decay.  

early_stopping_rounds: Specifies the number of rounds to monitor the evaluation loss when early_stopping is enabled and validation data is specified. If the loss does not decrease compared to the current best loss within this period, training will be stopped.
output_best_val_model: Whether to outputs the model with the best val loss or the model from the last epoch.

Functionality-wise, this node is identical with PtTrainClassificationModelLr except that you can specify a custom loss function in this model where PtTrainClassificationModelLr uses nn.CrossEntropyLoss().
